Weiss Schwarz Â©bushiroad All Rights Reserved.

This plugin for MSE2 (or Magic Set Editor 2) is designed to make custom cards for Weiss Schwarz, a TCG from Bushiroad. There's actually 2 major card forks for this plugin; one is by Benitez and is currently developed by Chairman, and the other (which is the the older one from sion) is currently this fork.

This fork supports the newest mechanics, including "Link", "Choice", "Replay", "Standby", three traits, long 2nd trait, etc., but does not support "Japanese Text Name Bar" found exclusively in English Imported Sets. This set also supports foil/SP mechanics, but not SEC.

## Known Issues
#### I cannot type in Korean/Japanese!
This has been reported to be a [known issue](https://github.com/twanvl/MagicSetEditor2/issues/121) in MSE 2.1.2. In order to resolve this issue, please instead download [this version of MSE](https://github.com/haganbmj/MagicSetEditor2/releases/tag/v2.2.2) while waiting for an update that hopefully fixes the issue. I have not created this plugin with these languages in mind tho, so if you need to request some adjustments, please file a issue and attach your `.mse-set` file so I can work on it.
